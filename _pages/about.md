Hi there!👋 I am a first-year PhD student in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS)](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/) at [The University of Queensland (UQ)](https://www.uq.edu.au/), Brisbane, Australia.

I am a proud recipient of a full PhD scholarship from the [Queensland Digital Health Centre (QDHeC)](https://chsr.centre.uq.edu.au/research/queensland-digital-health-centre). My research is conducted as a member of the [Information Engineering Lab (ieLab)](https://ielab.io/) group, and I am supervised by [Dr. Teerapong Leelanupab](https://eecs.uq.edu.au/profile/10170/teerapong-leelanupab) and [Prof. Guido Zuccon](https://about.uq.edu.au/experts/22857).

I hold a Master of Engineering Science degree from UQ, completed in July 2025.

**My research interests lie at the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Healthcare Informatics, with a particular focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** . Specifically, I am focusing on the following two areas:

1.Leveraging LLMs for various applications in the healthcare domain.

2.The application of Agentic RAG systems for healthcare information access.

Beyond research, I also serve as a tutor for DATA7901 – Data Science Capstone Project.
